# followingEnemyInUnity

DISCLAIMER : No AI implied here, but I did this in another repo.

 Make an enemy that follows your player and rotates / flips on the X axis !

 1. Add a new sprite ot the scene (your enemy visuals).

 2. Add to it the corresponding script to your needs :
    - Enemy1 : 360 rotation
    - Enemy2 : FlipX method

3. Add a Rigidbody2D to it.

4. Add the references in the inspector.

You're all set !
